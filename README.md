 - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html) - *a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
 - [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - *a high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.*
 - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - *an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.*
 - [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - *an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python.*
 - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) - *a visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.*
 - [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) - *a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects*
